# WebDev_BootCamp

This repository will contain the  completed web development assignments from the Udemy course by Colt Steele.

Exercises and other assignments from the course have been organized by type and topic.

Although some of the code will seem random, each file implements a set of techniques important to develop a good web development foundation.

All assignments have been completed by myself and either by working alone or with instructions from the bootcamp lectures.
